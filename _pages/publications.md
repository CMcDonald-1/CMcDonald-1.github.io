## Overview

This page contains a list of my publications. My early work focused on stochastic control theory and observability of Hidden Markov Models. Namely, given “bad” initial information, can a decision maker correct this mistake with the arrival of new information and make good control decisions after enough observation of the system. This topic relates to filter stability and robust control.

In my recent work in my PhD, I have continued in the vein of stochastic processes, but I am now more interested in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), optimal transport, and generative models- various methods to produce data from a given distribution. Ultimately, I would like to apply a stochastic approach to train neural networks not using back propagation but treating the parameters as a sampling problem. Namely, can we sample weights proportional to the exponential of the negative loss function, thus producing weights with low loss with high probability. This converts a non-convex optimization problem into a non-log concave sampling problem, which has more freedom to explore the state space and not get stuck in local minima. In my recent 2024 ISIT publication I explore how posterior sampling for neural networks can be written as a series of log concave sampling problems, thus amenable to rapid MCMC sampling methods.

I have also had the opportunity to collaborate on several data science projects. The first project is a natural language processing project with colleagues in social science. Using sentiment analysis and topic modeling, we analysed the text in large collections of social media posts to gauge user civility in conversations as well as response to COVID-19 vaccine information. Secondly, data analysis for orthopedic knee surgery research measuring a novel metric for measuring knee health.
