This page contains a list of my publications. My early work focused on stochastic control theory and observability of Hidden Markov Models. Namely, given “bad” initial information, can a decision maker correct this mistake with the arrival of new information and make good control decisions after enough observation of the system. This topic relates to filter stability and robust control.

In my recent work in my PhD, I have continued in the vein of stochastic processes, but I am now more interested in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), optimal transport, and generative models- various methods to produce data from a given distribution. Ultimately, I would like to apply a stochastic approach to train neural networks not using back propagation but treating the parameters as a sampling problem. Namely, can we sample weights proportional to the exponential of the negative loss function, thus producing weights with low loss with high probability. This converts a non-convex optimization problem into a non-log concave sampling problem, which has more freedom to explore that state space and not get stuck in local minima. Recent advances in score based approaches to sampling have shown much success as a generative model in high dimensions, and in my most recent NeurIPS workshop paper I explore how such success can be transferred to sampling a given density function.
